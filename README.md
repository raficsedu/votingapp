## Install
First clone this project into your machine/pc. This project can be run into both **Docker** and **Virtual Environment**

### Docker
1. Clone the project with ..
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/raficsedu/votingapp.git
    ```
2. Install ***Docker*** and ***Dcoker Composer*** from their official web site based on your machine OS.
3. Create a .env file in the directory where the settings.py file resides and chage the database name, user and pass according to your choice.

    ```
    SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-pku+v1sfow-d#p)--e^8cgti2-csfb_6x-&idobcpc2a8pvql9
    DEBUG=True
    POSTGRES_HOST_NAME=db
    POSTGRES_NAME=voting_app  
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres  
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=@mypass
    ```
    Use the same POSTGRES_NAME, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD value in docker-compose.yml file in db service under environment section.
    ```
    environment:  
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres  
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=@mypass  
      - POSTGRES_DB=voting_app
    ```
4. Go to the project directory and run ..
    ```
    1. sudo docker-compose build
    2. sudo docker-compose up
    ```
5. Migrate all the migration files ..
    ```
    sudo docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
    ```
 
6. If the build throws error due to log folder missing, then you need to create a folder named "log" in the project root directory.

Now open up your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.


### Virtual Environment
1. Clone the project with ..
	```
	git clone https://github.com/raficsedu/votingapp.git
	```
2. Install ***Virtual Environment*** using pip.
3. Create a .env file in the directory where the settings.py file resides and chage the database name, user and pass according to your choice. Create the database in your machine Postgresql.

	```
	SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-pku+v1sfow-d#p)--e^8cgti2-csfb_6x-&idobcpc2a8pvql9
	DEBUG=True
	POSTGRES_HOST_NAME=127.0.0.1
	POSTGRES_NAME=voting_app  
	POSTGRES_USER=postgres  
	POSTGRES_PASSWORD=@mypass
	```
4. Go to the project directory and run ..
	```
	1. source env/bin/activate
	2. pip install -r requirements.txt
	3. python manage.py migrate
	4. python manage.py runserver
	```

Now open up your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Error log and Automatic Test

All exceptions and logs will be written into error.log file. So create a folder named "log" into your main project root directory and error.log file will create automatically.
```
log/error.log
```
For running all the automatic test cases, run the following commands. You must need to be inside virtual environment or into docker container.
```
1. python manage.py test employer
2. python manage.py test restaurant
3. python manage.py test common
4. python manage.py test vote
```
